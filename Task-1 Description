Task 1: Chatbot Development

Data Collection:
You can use publicly available conversation datasets like the Cornell Movie Dialogues or create your own using conversation snippets.

Text Preprocessing:
Tokenize sentences, remove stopwords, normalize text (lowercase, stemming, etc.), and handle misspellings.

Libraries: NLTK, spaCy.

Intent Recognition:
Start with simple keyword-based matching, then move on to machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) or deep learning models like LSTM or transformers (BERT).

Response Generation:
For predefined responses, use a template-based approach.
For more flexibility, you could use sequence-to-sequence models, such as an encoder-decoder architecture or GPT-based models.

User Interaction:
Implement the chatbot interface using frameworks like Flask or Django, or integrate it with messaging platforms like Telegram or Facebook Messenger.

Learning and Improvement:
Use reinforcement learning or store chat logs to refine the model based on user feedback.
