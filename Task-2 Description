Task 2: Object Detection and Tracking System

Data Collection:
You can use existing datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, or capture your own videos for specific objects.

Data Preprocessing:
Convert videos into individual frames and annotate them using tools like LabelImg or CVAT for bounding boxes.

Model Selection:
YOLO is faster for real-time applications, while Faster R-CNN provides higher accuracy but might be slower.

Model Training:
Use transfer learning if your dataset is small, by fine-tuning pre-trained models on COCO or ImageNet.

Real-time Detection:
Integrate your trained model with OpenCV for real-time video streams.

Object Tracking:
Use Kalman filters or more sophisticated techniques like SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) to track objects over frames.

Visualization:
OpenCV can help you overlay bounding boxes, track paths, and display video results.
